2. The code provided in the repository contains many file that we have not created/worked on.
3. A Majority of the files we worked on are under the 'models', 'views', and 'controllers' directory. 


The Final Countdown web app is a time tracking program to keep track of time spent on
various tasks throughout the day. A user can sign in on whatever computer they are
using and add use a built-in stopwatch to record how much time is spent on whatever
project that they want to monitor. Tags can be created and assigned to tasks to allow
filtering of the tasks. This filtering helps the user analyze how much time has been
devoted to that tag or “category” of work.

The app runs on the Web2Py framework which is an all-included package. Web2Py is
hosted on the platform PythonAnywhere.com which specializes in python webapps and
specifically supports Web2Py. Once this is configured, the webapp can be run and even
changed via the web interface.
The Web2Py framework is built on top of an implementation of SQLite and its own web
server which takes care of most of the setup steps automatically. This leaves the
developer free to build their app without spending time on the platform.
Built in to the framework is a robust access control system called Auth.This allows for
the creation of user accounts and assignment of access levels. With secure account
creation and permissions assigned by the administrator on the back-end, the app runs
very securely. The back-end account is the main potential attack vector and needs to be
secured with a strong password.
